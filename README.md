# CORE Strategist's Edition
This is a specialized version of the CORE thinking tool, adapted for strategic planning, wargaming, and competitive analysis. It replaces abstract concepts with a practical vocabulary for strategists, allowing you to map out complex operational environments.

Use it to visualize plans, analyze threats and opportunities, track resources, and simulate courses of action. The goal is to move beyond linear plans and embrace the dynamic, interconnected nature of strategy.

### ‚ú® New in this Edition

  * **Multiple Connections:** A chunk can now link to multiple other chunks. Clicking the unlink icon on a chunk with links will open a menu to manage them individually.
  * **Strategic Templates:** Instantly load frameworks like SWOT, OODA Loop, or Course of Action (COA) Development from the 'Templates' button to kickstart your analysis.
  * **Layer Control:** Use the 'Layers' dropdown to show or hide chunks based on their color tag. This is crucial for managing complexity and focusing on specific aspects of your plan (e.g., view only Friendly Assets or filter out all Support chunks).
  * **Timeline View:** Switch to a chronological 'Timeline View' to see your plan unfold sequentially. This view organizes chunks from top-to-bottom, perfect for reviewing phased operations or after-action reports.
  * **Custom Chunk Types:** Define your own strategic vocabulary in the Settings modal. If you need a `#PhaseLine` or `#EconomicFactor` chunk, you can create it yourself.
  * **Strategic Vocabulary:** Chunk Types and Shapes have been updated with military and strategic planning in mind (e.g., `#objective`, `#threat`, ‚öî for conflict).
